# web-audio-api-demo
To see how powerful the Web Audio API is, I tried to build a synthesizer that runs in the browser and managed to build the following functionality into the "synth".Â 

1. Three oscillators.
2. Pitch controls for each oscillator.
3. Three-channel mixer.
4. Reverb effect on the master channel.
5. Keyboard to play C major scale (so we won't sound awful).
6. Release envelop for key release.
7. Oscilloscope (so we can see the actual waveshape).

We can use [Web Audio Inspector](https://github.com/google/audion/wiki/How-to-Use) to see what's happening under the hood and this is how it looks for our setup. It's very convenient to see which module links to which while debugging the code.
